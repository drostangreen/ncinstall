Nextcloud Install Script for Cameron

## You're welcome! Ungrateful ;)
Allows for Cameron (and anyone that wants to) to install the latest nextcloud in a few minutes.

## How to use
Clone the script then change directory into repo
Adjust any settings that you see fit (Passwords should be changed to something secure)
Run either -h or --help to see other options
Profit
